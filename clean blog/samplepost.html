                Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive <br>
                 of the world as one:a single sphere, a globe, having the <br>
                 qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions <br>
                 eventually meet, in which there is no center because every <br>
                 point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men <br>
                 occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will <br>
                 be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.

                Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for <br>
                 both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. <br>
                 The early warnings about technological dangers also come <br>
                 from science.

                What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that <br>
                 man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.
            </p>
            <p>
                A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl <br>
                 who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather <br>
                 than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the <br>
                 first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.
            </p>
            <p>
                For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the <br>
                 hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the <br>
                 experience most certainly changes your perspective. The <br>
                 things that we share in our world are far more valuable than <br>
                 those which divide us.

            <p>
                There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ <br>
                 Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the <br>
                 generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, <br>
                 there is always the thrill of just beginning.

                The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of <br>
                 tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict <br>
                 too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.

                Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one <br>
                 man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which <br>
                 mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of <br>
                 human development.

            <h1>Reaching for the Stars</h1>
            <p>
                As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in <br>
                 size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful <br>
                 you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so <br>
                 fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would <br>
                 crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.

            Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship <br>
             Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new <br>
             worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go <br>
             where no man has gone before.

            As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I <br>
             sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man <br>
             must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.
